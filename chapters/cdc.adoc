=== What is Change Data Capture?

* A design pattern that tracks and captures changes in data
* Monitors `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations
* Records the complete history of data modifications
* Enables real-time data synchronization

=== CDC Use Cases

* Data replication and synchronization
* Event-driven architectures
* Audit trails and compliance
* Real-time analytics
* Microservices data consistency

=== CDC Implementation Patterns

|===
| Pattern | Description
| Trigger-based | Uses database triggers to capture changes
| Log-based | Reads database transaction logs
| Timestamp-based | Polls for records based on timestamp
| Version-based | Tracks changes using version numbers

=== CDC in Apache Iceberg

* Uses Row-level Change Data as a first-class feature
* Tracks changes through metadata and snapshots
* Implements Position Delete Files for tracking deletions
* Enables Equality Delete Files for row-level changes

=== How Iceberg Implements CDC

* Maintains snapshot history for all table changes
* Records metadata for each modification in manifest files
* Enables time travel queries to access historical data
* Provides change data through SQL extensions (`CHANGES`, `AS OF`)
* Supports streaming ingestion of change data
