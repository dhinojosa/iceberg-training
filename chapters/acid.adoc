=== What are ACID Transactions?

ACID is an acronym that describes the key properties guaranteed by database transactions::

* Atomicity
* Consistency
* Isolation
* Durability

=== ACID Properties Explained

[cols="1b,4",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Description
| Atomicity | All operations in a transaction succeed or they all fail (all-or-nothing)
| Consistency | Data remains in a consistent state before and after transaction
| Isolation | Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
| Durability | Once committed, changes are permanent even if system fails

=== Why ACID Matters in Iceberg

* Ensures data reliability and consistency
* Prevents data corruption during concurrent operations
* Maintains data integrity during system failures
* Supports multi-table transactions within same catalog

=== Data Lakes and ACID Transactions

* Traditional data lakes typically do not support ACID transactions
* Most data lakes only provide eventual consistency
* Common issues include:
** Partial file writes
** Concurrent write conflicts
** No rollback capabilities
* Modern Data Lake systems like Iceberg add ACID guarantees

=== ACID Transactions Across Catalogs

* Currently not supported across different catalog implementations
* Each catalog maintains its own transaction context
* Key limitations:
** No atomic commits across catalogs
** No distributed rollback capability
** Potential consistency issues

=== Cross-Catalog Operations Best Practices

* Keep related tables in the same catalog
* Use staging tables for cross-catalog operations
* Implement application-level transaction management
* Consider using change data capture (CDC) patterns
