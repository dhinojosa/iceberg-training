=== What is Apache Iceberg

* Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets
* It was originally developed by Netflix and later donated to Apache Software Foundation

=== Features of Apache Iceberg

* Schema evolution
* Hidden partitioning
* Time travel capabilities
* ACID transactions
* Rolling back to previous versions

=== What does it solve that others can't?

Previously this was done by Hive Tables, but some issues were::

* Partition layout issues
* Schema evolution limitations
* Performance with many partitions

=== What is an Open Table Format?

* An open table format is a specification that defines how data is stored, organized, and managed in a table-based structure.
* It provides a standard way to store and access data independently of the processing engine or platform being used.

=== What does Open Table Format Provide?

* Platform independence—works across different computing engines
* Specification transparency—openly documented format that anyone can implement
* Metadata management—defines how table metadata is stored and updated
* Data organization—specifies how files are structured and managed
* Schema handling—provides rules for schema definition and evolution
* Transaction support—defines how concurrent operations are handled
* Version control—enables tracking changes and managing table history
* Community-driven—developed and maintained through open collaboration

=== Types of Compute Engines

Works with multiple compute engines including::

* Apache Spark
* Apache Flink
* Apache Hive
* Presto/Trino

=== Types of Storage

Supports multiple storage locations::
* S3 (including Min.io)
* HDFS
* Azure Blob Storage
* Google Cloud Storage

=== Comparison with Other Table Formats

=== Apache Hive

* Traditional table format for Hadoop
* Limited schema evolution capabilities
* Manual partition management required
* No ACID transactions in default configuration
* Performance issues with many partitions

=== Delta Lake

* Developed by Databricks
* Built primarily for Spark
* Provides ACID transactions
* Schema enforcement and evolution
* Time travel capabilities
* Limited support for non-Spark engines

=== Apache Hudi

* Developed by Uber
* Supports incremental processing
* Provides upsert capabilities
* Complex architecture
* Steeper learning curve
* Limited multi-engine support

=== Apache Iceberg

* Engine-agnostic design
* Advanced schema evolution
* Hidden partitioning
* Full ACID compliance
* Extensive time travel support
* Simple architecture
* Strong consistency guarantees
