=== Evolution of Schema Management

=== Traditional Data Warehouses (Schema-on-Write)

* Strict schema enforcement during data ingestion
* Data cleaned and transformed before storage
* High upfront processing costs
* Limited flexibility for schema changes
* Better query performance due to optimized storage

=== Data Lakes (Schema-on-Read)

* Raw data stored without schema enforcement
* Schema applied only when reading data
* Faster data ingestion
* More flexible for changing requirements
* Higher query-time processing overhead
* Potential data quality issues

=== Apache Iceberg (Modern Schema-on-Write)

* Schema enforcement during writing but with evolution support
* Atomic schema changes without table locks
* Built-in schema version control
* Efficient query performance
* Support for complex data types
* Compatible with multiple processing engines

=== Schema Evolution Fundamentals

* Tables track the full schema history
* Multiple schema versions can coexist
* Forward and backward compatibility
* No table rewrites required
* Schema changes are atomic operations

=== Schema Evolution Operations

* Add new columns (nullable or with defaults)
* Rename existing columns
* Reorder columns
* Promote types (widening conversions)
* Update column types with compatible changes
* Drop columns (soft delete)

=== Schema Evolution Compatibility Rules

* Integer widening (`int` -> `long`)
* Decimal precision widening
* String type updates (`string` -> `varchar`)
* Struct field additions
* List and map value type updates
* Optional field additions
* Required fields cannot be nullable

=== Schema Evolution Constraints

* Changes must be compatible with existing data
* Cannot arbitrarily reorganize schema structure
* Must maintain backward compatibility
* Schema changes are additive by default

=== Incompatible Schema Changes

* Type narrowing (`long` -> `int`)
* Changing required fields to optional
* Removing or renaming required columns
* Incompatible type changes (`string` -> `int`)
* Changing array/map key types
* Modifying nested struct ordering
