=== Compacting

Compacting in Apache Iceberg is the process of combining smaller data files into larger ones to optimize read performance and reduce metadata overhead.

==== Why Compacting is Necessary

* Reduces the total number of data files in a table
* Improves query performance by minimizing file open operations
* Decreases metadata size and processing overhead
* Optimizes storage costs and system resources
* Helps maintain consistent file sizes for better I/O efficiency

==== How Compacting is Done

* Through Spark SQL using `REWRITE DATA` command
* Via programmatic API calls in Spark, Flink, or other engines
* Can be scheduled as maintenance jobs
* Supports both bin-packing and sort-based strategies
* Allows specification of target file size and sort orders
* Preserves snapshot isolation during a compaction process
