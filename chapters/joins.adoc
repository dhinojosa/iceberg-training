=== Same Catalog Joins

* Standard SQL JOIN syntax works with Iceberg tables in the same catalog
* Supports all join types: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`, `CROSS`
* Join conditions can use any column from participating tables
* Optimize joins by aligning partition strategies between tables
* Leverage Iceberg's metadata for efficient join planning

=== Cross-Catalog Joins

* Use fully qualified table names including catalog: `catalog_name.database.table`
* Cross-catalog joins require proper catalog configurations in your engine
* Support varies by query engine (Spark, Trino, etc.)
* May need additional access permissions for both catalogs
* Performance considerations when joining across different storage locations
