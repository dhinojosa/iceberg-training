=== Catalog Service

A catalog service is the backing implementation that knows how to::
* Resolve logical table names
* Manage metadata pointers
* Handle commits/updates safely
* Enable multi-engine access

=== Types of Catalog in Iceberg

[cols="1,2,4", options="header"]
|===
| Catalog Type     | What It Uses                         | When to Use

| REST Catalog
| A stateless HTTP server + object store
| Great for multi-engine, containerized setups (like Docker Compose).
Easy to secure and scale. Engine-neutral.

| Hive Catalog
| Hive Metastore (HMS)
| Common in legacy Hadoop/Spark setups.
Can reuse existing infrastructure.

| Glue Catalog
| AWS Glue Data Catalog
| Native for AWS environments.
Serverless, IAM-integrated.

[cols="1,2,4", options="header"]
|===
| Catalog Type     | What It Uses                         | When to Use
| Nessie Catalog
| Git-like versioned catalog (via REST)
| When you want branching, versioning, and promotion (like Git for data).

| Hadoop Catalog
| Stores metadata in file system paths
| Not shared across engines. Unsafe for multi-writer setups.

| In-memory Catalog
| Temporary in-memory storage
| Not persistent. Demo-only.
