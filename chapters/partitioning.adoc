=== Partitioning

* Partitioning in Iceberg is declarative and type-safe
* Supports hidden partitioning (consumers don't need partition knowledge)
* Maintains partition evolution without data migration
* Stores partition values using correct types (not just strings)

=== Partition Types

* Identity partitioning (direct column values)
* Transform partitioning:
** Year, month, day from timestamps
** Hour from timestamps
** Truncate on numbers or strings
** Bucket transform for scaling

=== Partition Features

* Supports multiple partition fields
* Automatic partition pruning during queries
* Schema evolution without partition changes
* No need for partition folder management
* Built-in partition validation and verification

=== Partition Benefits

* Improved query performance through data skipping
* Efficient metadata filtering
* Reduced storage costs through better organization
* Simplified partition management
* Compatible with multiple storage formats
